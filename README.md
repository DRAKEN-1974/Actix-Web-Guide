About
-----
This repository collects practical Actix Web examples and patterns for building production-quality web services with Rust and Actix Web (examples target Actix Web 4+ unless otherwise noted). It focuses on small, well-documented samples and common real-world patterns.

Badges
------
- CI: shows status of your GitHub Actions workflow (adjust workflow path/name if needed)
- License: link to repository LICENSE
- Rust: indicates target Rust toolchain
- Actix Web: indicates recommended major Actix version
- Top language & Stars: quick repository metadata

Prerequisites
-------------
- Rust toolchain (stable) — install via rustup: https://rustup.rs/
- Cargo (comes with rustup)
- Optional: Docker for containerized runs
- Optional: PostgreSQL / SQLite or other DB depending on examples (check example READMEs)

Getting started
---------------
Clone and build locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DRAKEN-1974/Actix-Web-Guide.git
cd Actix-Web-Guide
cargo build
```
here you must see that before running the cargo build i will tell you to open the respective folder you want to use.
as there are respective folder which will contain specific projects and building the whole repo is of no use.

Many examples live in `production-ready` or `basic-examples`. Check each example’s header/comments for required env vars, ports, or DB setup.



Project structure
-----------------
A typical layout (your repository may vary slightly):

- Cargo.toml
- README.md
- LICENSE
- src/
  - main.rs        # optional main app
  - lib.rs         # library core for shared code
  - bin/           # additional binaries
- docs/            # extended guides and design notes
- tests/           # integration tests

I have aslo divided the project in two main folders where one contains the program that i have tried to write equal to the production grade (it is not up to the mark but you would ot have to write the whole code atleast) whereas the second one is basic programs where  i have just created programs to get an idea that how it works.NOTE:-I will convert some of the basic-examples into the prod-grade code so if anyone you come to contribute you can do that too.


Included guides & examples
--------------------------
Expect to find (see repository for exact filenames):
- Basic server: routing, JSON request/response, simple handlers
- Extractors: Path, Query, Json, Form, Payload usage patterns
- Middleware: logging, auth, request IDs, rate limiting
- Authentication: cookie sessions, JWT examples
- Database access: integration examples with sqlx/diesel/sea-orm and pooling
- Error handling: custom errors and ResponseError implementations
- WebSockets: chat/demo using actix-web actors or plain websockets
- File uploads & streaming: handling large payloads without OOM
- Async patterns: spawn_blocking, graceful shutdown, long-running tasks
- Testing: unit and integration examples using actix-test


Deployment & production notes
-----------------------------
- I haven`t deployed any of them but i have tested them using the real database and postman and curl and i believe most of them works but if you guys find any issue please feel free to pin it out.
- and if you can please raise a pr and fix that i will merge it.


Contributing
------------
Contributions are welcome — issues, PRs, and examples. Suggested workflow:
1. Open an issue to discuss larger changes or new guides.
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
3. Submit a PR with a clear description and tests/examples where applicable.

Guidelines:
- Keep examples focused and minimal.
- Document external services, env vars, and version assumptions.
- Add tests for behavior changes where possible.
- NOTE: - VIBE CODDERS ARE REQUESTED TO STAY AWAY.

License
-------
See the LICENSE file in this repository for the repository license. The license badge above links to it.
I think there is some mit licenese which is popular so yes that is what i am using .
